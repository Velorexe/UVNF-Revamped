# ⚠️ WARNING - THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT IN A FUNCTIONAL STATE - WARNING ⚠️
Although I published it publicly on GitHub, I'm still working on this new revamped version of my old framework. For now there are no functional working parts to the Visual Novel side of things. I'll publish a roadmap to show where I am and where the framework is going soon. With the current state of this repo, you won't be able to create a functioning VN or game.

# UVNF (R) - Unity Visual Novel Framework
UVNF (R) aims to give users a set of tools and pre-made commands to create dialogue systems for Visual Novel-esque games. With a focus for writers, but dynamic enough to provide support for visual editing systems (like a node-graph), it aims to let everyone create their Visual Novel with their own expertise.

    Here's a preview of my aim for the framework: from text commands to Unity. Converting those commands to their own C# class with properties binding to text parameters.
    On top of this converting feature, I want to build what my previous framework also had: a Node Graph, but also other tools.
